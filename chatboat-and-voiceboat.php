  <p class="mt-4 fs18">In the rapidly evolving landscape of higher education, institutions constantly seek innovative
solutions to enhance support services and improve student experience. One such solution recently gaining traction is generative AI chatbots and voicebots. These advanced technologies leverage artificial intelligence to personalized, efficient, accessible support to students, faculty, and staff. In this blog, we'll explore the transformative potential of generative AI chatbots and voicebots in the higher education space.</p>

    <p class="cinzel fs30 mt-4"><b>Understanding Generative AI Chatbots and Voicebots</b></p>
    <p class="mt-3 fs18">Generative AI chatbots and voicebots are sophisticated software applications powered by
artificial intelligence algorithms. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on predefined responses,
generative AI and voicebots can generate human-like responses and engage in natural language
conversations. They are trained on large datasets and use machine learning techniques to
understand context, infer meaning, and develop relevant responses to user queries.</p>
